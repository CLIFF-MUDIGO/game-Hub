## Project Description
this project is a web application that displays a list of popular games using the RAWG video games database API. The app displays the games' titles, release dates, and ratings. Users can click a button to show or hide the list of games. Additionally, they can add games to their favorites and remove them from their favorites list. The app also has a review feature that allows users to write reviews for the games and see other users' reviews. The app uses React for the frontend and CSS for styling.
